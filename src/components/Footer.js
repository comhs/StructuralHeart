      <h4>More about the Community Healthcare System cardiovascular program</h4>
      <p class="about">The high volume of procedures we perform give us the experience to produce excellent outcomes. Our forward-thinking hybrid cardiac catheterization and hybrid operating rooms provide dedicated spaces where interventional cardiologists and surgeons can collaborate to provide patients the best possible care.</p>
      <p class="about">Community Healthcare System is also home of the most comprehensive and experienced heart program. Minimally invasive procedures to treat valve disease, such as TAVR (Trans catheter Aortic Valve Replacement) and MitraClipâ„¢ for mitral valve regurgitation help us lead the way in heart care.</p>
